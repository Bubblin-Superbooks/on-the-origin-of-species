<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">described a most curious case of ten graduated forms of Planorbis multiformis in the successive beds of a fresh-water formation in Switzerland. Although each formation has indisputably required a vast number of years for its deposition, several reasons can be given why each should not commonly include a graduated series of links between the species which lived at its commencement and close, but I cannot assign due proportional weight to the following considerations.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each probably is short compared with the period requisite to change one species into another.
