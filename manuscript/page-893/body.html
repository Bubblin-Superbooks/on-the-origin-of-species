<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">in North America, do not support the view that the older a formation is the more invariably it has suffered extreme denudation and metamorphism.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained. To show that it may hereafter receive some explanation, I will give the following hypothesis. From the nature of the organic remains which do not appear to have inhabited profound depths, in the several formations of Europe and of the United States; and from the amount of sediment, miles in thickness, of which the formations are composed, we may infer that from first to last large islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was derived, occurred in the neighbourhood of the now existing continents of Europe and North America. This same view has since been maintained by Agassiz and others. But we do not know what was the state of things in the intervals</p></div> </div>
