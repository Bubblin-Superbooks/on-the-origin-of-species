Moreover, when, by sudden immigration or by unusually rapid development, many species of a new group have taken possession of an area, many of the older species will have been exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner; and the forms which thus yield their places will commonly be allied, for they will partake of the same inferiority in common.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Thus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole groups of species become extinct accords well with the theory of natural selection.
