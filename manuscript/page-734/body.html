offspring not universal—Hybrids and mongrels compared independently of
their fertility—Summary.</p><p>The view commonly entertained by naturalists is that species, when intercrossed, have been specially endowed with sterility, in order to prevent their confusion. This view certainly seems at first highly probable, for species living together could hardly have been kept distinct had they been capable of freely crossing. The subject is in many ways important for us, more especially as the sterility of species when first crossed, and that of their hybrid offspring, cannot have been acquired, as I shall show, by the preservation of successive profitable degrees of sterility. It is an incidental result of differences in the reproductive systems of the parent-species.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent fundamentally different, have generally been</p></div> </div>
