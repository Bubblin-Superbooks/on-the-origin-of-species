There is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent their crossing and blending in nature, than to think that trees have been specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent their inarching in our forests.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The sterility of first crosses and of their hybrid progeny has not been acquired through natural</p></div> </div>
