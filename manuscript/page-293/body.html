But we may go further than this; for as new forms are produced, unless we admit that specific forms can go on indefinitely increasing in number, many old forms must become extinct. That the number of specific forms has not indefinitely increased, geology plainly tells us; and we shall presently attempt to show why it is that the number of species throughout the world has not become immeasurably great.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">We have seen that the species which are most numerous in individuals have the best chance of producing favourable variations within any given period.
