These two groups of genera will thus form two distinct families, or orders, according to the amount of divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram. And the two new families, or orders, are descended from two species of the original genus; and these are supposed to be descended from some still more ancient and unknown form.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">We have seen that in each country it is the species belonging to the larger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species.
