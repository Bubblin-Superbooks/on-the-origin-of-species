<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>On The Absence Or Rarity Of Transitional Varieties.</h4><p class="  start-chapter">As natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications, each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to take the place of, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved parent-form and other less-favoured forms with which it comes into competition. Thus extinction and natural selection go hand in hand. Hence, if we look at each species as descended from some unknown form, both the parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very process of the formation and perfection of the new form.</p></div> </div>
