In this case, intermediate varieties between the several representative species and their common parent, must formerly have existed within each isolated portion of the land, but these links during the process of natural selection will have been supplanted and exterminated, so that they will no longer be found in a living state.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different portions of a strictly continuous</p></div> </div>
