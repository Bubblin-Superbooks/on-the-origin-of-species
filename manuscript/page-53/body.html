There is, also, some probability in the view propounded by Andrew Knight, that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food. It seems clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to new conditions to cause any great amount of variation; and that, when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues varying for many generations. No case is on record of a variable organism ceasing to vary under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">As far as I am able to judge, after long attending to the subject, the conditions of life appear to act in two waysâ€”directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone and in directly by affecting the reproductive system.
